                <h2>AI-Based Chronic Lower Back Pain Detection using Pose Estimation Models</h2>
                <p>
                    <h4>Description:</h4>
                    As a dedicated and innovative AI engineer, I led a groundbreaking project aimed at improving the lives of individuals suffering from 
                    chronic lower back pain.Leveraging cutting-edge AI technologies, specifically OpenCV and MobileNet,
                    I developed a robust and accurate system for the early detection and monitoring of chronic lower back pain.

                <h2>Keypoints Graphs based on predicted heatmap images</h2>
                <p>I led the "KeyPoints Graphs from Predicted Heatmap Images" project as a pivotal component of our Chronic Lower Back Pain Detection team's 
                    efforts. In our endeavor, we first trained a neural network, typically a convolutional neural network (CNN), to generate heatmaps from input
                     medical images of the lower back. These heatmaps served as spatial representations of key anatomical points or landmarks crucial for lower 
                     back pain assessment. Following heatmap generation, our project focused on precisely localizing these key points by identifying peak values
                      in the heatmaps, which indicated the most probable positions of these critical anatomical features associated with chronic lower back pain.
                </p>
                <p> We then proceeded to construct a graph-based representation, where each key point was treated as a node, interconnected within the graph 
                    based on their spatial relationships. This innovative approach allowed us to gain valuable insights into the structural aspects of the lower
                     back, facilitating more accurate and comprehensive detection of chronic lower back pain.</p>

                <p>Our project played a significant role in enhancing the accuracy and effectiveness of our Chronic Lower Back Pain Detection system. 
                    To ensure real-time processing and robust results, we worked extensively on optimization techniques, including hardware acceleration and model compression. 
                    We also employed data augmentation, model ensembling, and post-processing steps to further enhance the reliability of our detection results. Moreover, we 
                    devoted considerable effort to building a robust dataset containing annotated lower back images to train and rigorously evaluate our model.</p>
